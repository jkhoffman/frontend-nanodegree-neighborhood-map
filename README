NEIGHBORHOOD MAP
================

This is a map of my home town of Matthews, North Carolina. It's composed of two
pieces, a server and a client.

The server is very simple. Built in Express (which rests atop Node.js), its
primary function is to delegate Yelp API requests (and handle authentication
via OAuth.) Beyond that, it serves static files from the public/ folder and
that's about it.

The client is built on Knockout.js and jQuery. It uses Google's Geolocation API
to determine lat/long for the markers, and the Yelp API (via the server) for
location details. By using our own server to delegate OAuth requests to Yelp,
we avoid (a) having to distribute our Yelp API keys to the client and (b)
dealing with cross-domain AJAX requests.

The client should work on most popular mobile devices as well as the desktop.



INSTALLATION
============

First, install the required Node.js modules:

    npm install

Copy the sample server config file:

    cp server.config.json.sample server.config.json

Then, edit the server config file to provide your Yelp API credentials:

    vim server.config.json

You can get the required credentials from Yelp here:

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
==================

Run the server:

    node server.js

Open your browser to:

    http://localhost:8080/

Click on any of the markers to learn more about that location, courtesy of
data from the Yelp API. To see a full list of locations, click (or tap) the
hamburger menu on the top left. Type in the Search field to filter the list
in real-time. Click a location in the menu to select it on the map. To close
the menu, click/tap the hamburger menu or click/tap anywhere on the map.
